Age Prediction:

1. Read the 'requirement.txt' file for the necessary libraries.
2. Go to the download link 'http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/projects/IMFDB/' and download the dataset.
3. Open jupyter notebook and run all the cells (you have to run all the cells as I have not saved the model).
4. After running all the cells successfully it will open a tkinter window for Age Prediction.
